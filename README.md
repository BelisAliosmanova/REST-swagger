# REST-swagger
## Java internship homework.
My task was to create a rest server and use swagger. </br>
I also had to do a few github related tasks like commits, pull requests and so on. </br>
I created classes for Laptop, Processor and Manufacturer with the necessary connections between them. </br>
Improving the project... :)
